[cite_start]I am a Ph.D. candidate at the College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, China[cite: 2, 3, 5]. Currently, I am a Visiting Ph.D. [cite_start]Student at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, supervised by Prof. Dusit Niyato [cite: 6, 73] [cite_start]and Prof. Jun Zhao[cite: 76]. [cite_start]My Ph.D. supervisor at Chongqing University is Prof. Songtao Guo[cite: 70]. [cite_start]Previously, I obtained my M.S. degree from Central South University of Forestry and Technology[cite: 7, 8].

[cite_start]My research interests lie in the intersection of mobile computing and artificial intelligence[cite: 9]. Specifically, I focus on:
* [cite_start]Collaborative Edge Intelligence [cite: 10]
* [cite_start]On-Device Model Inference [cite: 11]
* [cite_start]Deep Reinforcement Learning Improvements & Applications [cite: 12]
* [cite_start]Aerial and Space assisted Edge Computing (UAV, RIS, Satellite) [cite: 13]

Research Experience
======
My research focuses on optimizing performance and resource utilization in complex computing networks.

* [cite_start]**On-Device AI Model Inference Optimization**: I proposed a GCN-driven evolutionary reinforcement learning method to address on-device model inference by adaptively partitioning neural network layers across edge nodes, considering resource constraints[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]**Intelligent Scheduling in Aerial and Space assisted Networks**: I have designed several novel algorithms for emerging network architectures, including an improved DE+TD3 algorithm for multi-UAV deployment [cite: 20][cite_start], a hybrid-action TD3 algorithm for RIS-assisted edge computing [cite: 22][cite_start], and a multi-agent MATD3 architecture for hierarchical scheduling in Ground-Air-Space networks[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Offloading and Resource Optimization in Edge Computing**: I formulated a bi-level optimization framework to solve delay-aware offloading [cite: 16] [cite_start]and designed a novel D2QN-based edge collaboration strategy to handle decentralized task scheduling under dynamic workloads[cite: 18].
